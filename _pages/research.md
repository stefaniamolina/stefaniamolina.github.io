**Unmarried Motherhood and Infant Health: The Role of Intimate Partner violence in Colombia**

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Research has shown that growing family diversity, including motherhood among unmarried women, is associated with child well-being. However, little is known about whether and how intimate partner violence (IPV) relates to family diversity and child outcomes. Colombia is an ideal case to study these relationships due to its high prevalence of unmarried motherhood and the large fraction of women affected by IPV. I study the association between mother's partnership status and low birth weight and examine the role of physical IPV during pregnancy in this relationship. The study draws from the Colombian Demographic and Health Surveys data (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015) and selects mothers with children aged 0–1 who are married, cohabiting, separated, or never in a union. Descriptive analysis shows trends across time in the partnership status of women with newborn children, and logistic regression models estimate how mother's partnership status is associated with low birth weight and how IPV during pregnancy affects this relationship. There is a steep increase in unmarried motherhood over time. Further, separated and cohabiting mothers are more likely than married mothers to experience IPV during pregnancy. Still, cohabitees' levels of IPV are decreasing across the observation period to become more like those of married women. IPV explains some differences in low birth weight between separated and married mothers but not among cohabitees and married mothers. The paper highlights the relevance of IPV – and, more generally, past partnership quality – when analyzing a mother's partnership status and its links to child outcomes.

**Divorce and Mental Health: Analysis at the Intersection of Age, Gender, and Income**<br>Enrique Alonso-Perez and Michaela Kreyenfeld<br>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper examines how divorce relates to mental health, and how this association is stratified by gender, age, and individual income. Data is drawn from German register data, which includes marital histories of divorcees and diagnosed health outcomes. The analytical sample includes persons aged 30-59 in 2015 (n=23,426,639). We employ a Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) in which the outcome variable is the annual incidence of mental disease diagnosis to compare the patterns of the newly divorced (divorced for less than four years) to the patterns of the never divorced. The analysis helps to identify high-risk populations along the age-gender-income spectrum. Compared to the never divorced, we find a very strong age gradient among newly divorced women. While age seems to be a general risk factor, the small group of women with a very high income face a relatively low risk of receiving a mental disease diagnosis. Among men, older and low-income males are at particularly high risk of being diagnosed with a mental disease.

**Family Structure, Parental Partnership Quality & Child Wellbeing: A Dyadic Approach**<br>Lena Wagner, Michaela Kreyenfeld, and Enrique Alonso-Perez<br>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This article adopts a dyadic and longitudinal perspective to examine how parental partnership quality relates to child wellbeing in Germany. A large body of research addresses whether and how parental partnership quality affects child wellbeing. While much of this research has been focused on couple households with biological children, less is known about patterns in post-separation families. This paper draws on longitudinal and dyadic data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam). The analytical sample includes heterosexual couples living with biological and/or stepchildren. We employ OLS regression and a mediation analysis to understand the relationship between family structure, parental relationship quality and children’s self-reported wellbeing. Results reveal that children in stepfamilies report higher SDQ scores (i.e., lower wellbeing) than those in nuclear families. Differences persist after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and parental partnership quality. Positive partnership quality benefits children in nuclear families more strongly than those in stepfamilies. Children in stepfamilies suffer more from negative parental partnership quality than those in nuclear families, though results vary depending on the frequency of conflict. Positive partnership quality, but not negative, is a significant mediator between family structure and child wellbeing.

**Union Dissolution and Mental Health: The Role of Conflict During Separation**<br>Michaela Kreyenfeld and Julie O´Sullivan<br>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This paper uses longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) to examine the relationship between separation and parental mental health (n= 774 separations). The outcome variable is depression, measured with the State-Trait Depression Scale (scale range zero to 30). We particular address the question how depression levels compare before and after union dissolution and whether patterns differ for conflictual and less conflict-ridden separations. Undergoing a conflict-ridden separation increases depression by more than one unit, on average, compared to having a less conflictual separation. However, there is strong selection into a conflict-ridden separation, particularly among women. The depressive symptoms of individuals who eventually end up in a conflict-ridden separation are already strongly elevated before the separation. The results of this analysis echo prior calls for early interventions prior to union breakdown, such as partnership counselling.
