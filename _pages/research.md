**Unmarried Motherhood and Infant Health: The Role of Intimate Partner violence in Colombia**

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Research has shown that growing family diversity, including motherhood among unmarried women, is associated with child well-being. However, little is known about whether and how intimate partner violence (IPV) relates to family diversity and child outcomes. Colombia is an ideal case to study these relationships due to its high prevalence of unmarried motherhood and the large fraction of women affected by IPV. I study the association between mother's partnership status and low birth weight and examine the role of physical IPV during pregnancy in this relationship. The study draws from the Colombian Demographic and Health Surveys data (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015) and selects mothers with children aged 0–1 who are married, cohabiting, separated, or never in a union. Descriptive analysis shows trends across time in the partnership status of women with newborn children, and logistic regression models estimate how mother's partnership status is associated with low birth weight and how IPV during pregnancy affects this relationship. There is a steep increase in unmarried motherhood over time. Further, separated and cohabiting mothers are more likely than married mothers to experience IPV during pregnancy. Still, cohabitees' levels of IPV are decreasing across the observation period to become more like those of married women. IPV explains some differences in low birth weight between separated and married mothers but not among cohabitees and married mothers. The paper highlights the relevance of IPV – and, more generally, past partnership quality – when analyzing a mother's partnership status and its links to child outcomes.

**Divorce and Mental Health: Analysis at the Intersection of Age, Gender, and Income**<br>with Enrique Alonso-Perez and Michaela Kreyenfeld<br>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper examines how divorce relates to mental health, and how this association is stratified by gender, age, and individual income. Data is drawn from German register data, which includes marital histories of divorcees and diagnosed health outcomes. The analytical sample includes persons aged 30-59 in 2015 (n=23,426,639). We employ a Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) in which the outcome variable is the annual incidence of mental disease diagnosis to compare the patterns of the newly divorced (divorced for less than four years) to the patterns of the never divorced. The analysis helps to identify high-risk populations along the age-gender-income spectrum. Compared to the never divorced, we find a very strong age gradient among newly divorced women. While age seems to be a general risk factor, the small group of women with a very high income face a relatively low risk of receiving a mental disease diagnosis. Among men, older and low-income males are at particularly high risk of being diagnosed with a mental disease.

**What Differences Does It Make? Parental Relationship Quality and Child Wellbeing in Step- and Nuclear Families**<br>with Lena Wagner, Michaela Kreyenfeld, and Enrique Alonso-Perez<br>
[Working Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tzdvw)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
A large body of research addresses whether and how parental partnership quality affects child wellbeing. While much of this research has focused on nuclear families, less is known about patterns in stepfamilies. This study adopts a dyadic perspective to explore how parental partnership quality relates to the wellbeing of children living with both biological parents versus those with a biological parent and a stepparent. We apply multivariable linear regression and a mediation analysis on longitudinal data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) to understand the relationship between family structure, step- and biological parent’s partnership quality and children’s self-reported wellbeing, operationalised over the Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ-scores). The analytical sample includes children who live in heterosexual couple households (n=1,781). We differentiate two separate dimensions of parental partnership quality, namely the frequency of conflict and esteem between the (step-)parents. Results show that children living with a stepparent exhibit higher total difficulties score compared to children living with both their biological parents. However, parental conflict occurs less and esteem more frequently in stepfamilies than in nuclear families. Mediation analysis indicates that partnership quality partially mediates the impact of family structure on SDQ scores. Our analysis suggests that the negative effect of living with stepparents on children’s socio-emotional wellbeing is slightly mitigated by increased parental esteem and lower conflict in these unions.

**Union Dissolution and Mental Health: The Role of Conflict During Separation**<br>with Michaela Kreyenfeld and Julie O´Sullivan<br>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This paper uses longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) to examine the relationship between separation and parental mental health (N=2,338). The outcome variable is depression, measured with the State-Trait Depression Scale (scale range zero to 30). We use fixed-effects regressions to address the question of how depression levels compare before and after separation with a matched control group. We further investigate differences in depression trajectories by gender and partnership quality. Undergoing a separation increases depression levels, but trajectories vary depending on gender and partnership quality. Depression levels gradually increase starting one year before separation among men in high-quality partnerships. Women who separate from a low-quality partnership have increased depression levels only one year before separation, suggesting that separation can be an escape route from dysfunctional relationships.

**Women's economic independence and intimate partner violence during separation** <br>with Lena Wagner and Michaela Kreyenfeld<br>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
A growing number of studies have addressed the issue of intimate partner violence (IPV). While some studies have suggested that women's economic independence reduces the risk of IPV, the empirical evidence is still inconclusive. In particular, little is known about the factors that increase or reduce the likelihood of experiencing physical IPV during the separation process. We use data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) for the years 2009-2022. The analytical sample consists of women who went through a separation since the last interview (n=789 person-years). We use logistic regression models to examine the determinants of the risks of physical IPV during separation. We find that mothers with minor children are at strongly elevated risk of physical IPV during separation controlling for key sociodemographic characteristics. Low education as well as non-employment increases risks of physical IPV during separation for mothers and non-mothers. However, non-employment is a particular risk factor for lower educated mothers. Divorce and separation, especially when minor children are involved, can be a highly stressful time when partner conflict escalates and, in some cases, culminates in violence against the partner. This paper highlights the importance of maternal labor market integration and economic independence as a lever to reduce physical IPV and conflict during separation.
