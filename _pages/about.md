I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/) organized by the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/people/doctoral-researchers2/fourth-cohort/stefania-molina). Previously, I obtained a Master in Public Policy from the Hertie School, Berlin and a Bachelor of Public Administration from Fundação Getulio Vargas, São Paulo.

My current research interests are in social and family demography, with a focus on health inequalities. In my dissertation, I analyze how diverse family forms and dynamics influence individuals' well-being.
