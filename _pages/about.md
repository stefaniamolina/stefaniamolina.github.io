I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/) organized by the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/people/doctoral-researchers2/fourth-cohort/stefania-molina). In November 2023 I will visit the Department of Sociology at [Oxford University](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/) and the Department of Population Health at [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/faculties/eph/department-population-health). Previously, I obtained an MPP from the Hertie School, Berlin and a BS in Public Administration from Fundação Getulio Vargas, São Paulo.

My current research interests are on social and family demography, focusing on health inequalities. In my dissertation, I focus on how diverse family forms and family dynamics influence children's health.
